## 🕒 Project Overview
Temperature measurement plays an important role across various sectors including industrial process monitoring,  healthcare, agriculture etc. Inaccurate or unavailable temperature readings can lead to damaged goods, wasted resources, and compromised safety. This project focused on developing a temperature-sensing device using the MAX6675 module and a K-type thermocouple, capable of  measuring the temperature of objects (through contact) as well as the surrounding environment.
